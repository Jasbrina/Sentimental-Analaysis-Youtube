"This is one of those songs that feel like a dream that I don't want to wake up from.  The song's melody feel like they're making a wish or plea, and it's like divine saccharine.  I haven't listened to it much, but maybe I should have given into the youtube algorithm and given it a better chance.  The repetition definitely helps reinforce that aspect of an unending dream.  I love it.

With these repeating vocals, it has become abundantly clear to me that I could listen to your voice all day long, no matter the genre.  Here, though, your soprano+ range serves you well and your voice is easily makes the best part about this song.  After listening to your cover and the original, there's just something about yours that I love.  Perhaps the autotune here feels less apparent, if it's there at all.  Maybe your chorus simply has much more emotion.  Maybe it's just the fact that each line ended felt like you had taken ahold of my heart.  I just don't want to let go of these feelings from this song.",UgwIcO04J3Zsv1_f-LV4AaABAg,0,1
